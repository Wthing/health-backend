In the world of limitless information, people still have a vague awareness of their health progress. Those one-off medical reports we get during check-ups don’t give a full insight of how our bodies evolve over time. To illustrate, Kazakhstan citizens use Damumed that provides a centralized system for electronic prescriptions and medical records. However, Damumed lacks a personalized dashboard that tracks health patterns over time, which makes it hard for people to see how their health changes. Without this long-term perspective, future medical treatments might fall short, offering little in the way of real improvement. That's why we thought of developing a personalised interactive software that monitors the history of person’s health and analyses current health state through not only last medical report, but also dynamics of organism components over the time. Our software could be helpful for people to take charge of their own health and make informed decisions alongside their healthcare providers.
